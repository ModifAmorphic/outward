## First-time Configuration
- Click "Start modded" in [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
- Press F5 to open up the Configuration Manager.
- Expand the __Extra Quickslots X.X.X__ section.
- Set the first setting, __ExtraQuickSlots__, to the Extra Quickslots you want. For example, entering 3 will add 3 quickslots to the existing 8 in the base game for a total of 11.
- __Restart the game__.  (Exit and "Start modded" in [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) again)
  - Restarting is required whenever this value is changed. Extra Quick Slots can currently only be added when the game first starts.

## Configuring Hotkeys
- The Extra Quick Slots will be at the top of the __Quick Slots__ section of the Keyboard settings.
- Configure them to whatever you like, keeping in mind keys may already be assigned elsewhere.
- Assign Items or Skills to your new slots.

## Alignment Options
- CenterQuickslotPanel - Just like it sounds, centers the QuickSlot bar to the horizontal center of the screen. You will probably need to make additional adjustments as the QuickSlot and Stability Bars will likely overlap.
- QuickSlotBarAlignmentOptions
 - MoveQuickSlotAboveStability: Moves the QuickSlot Bar above the Stability Bar.
 - MoveStabilityAboveQuickSlot: Moves the Stability Bar above the QuickSlot Bar.
