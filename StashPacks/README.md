# Description

StashPacks work by retrieving the contents of a stash whenever a stashpack is dropped on the ground.  Changes to a pack's contents are kept track of until the game saves, at which time those changes are applied to each stash area's save. (A ".bak" backup is made prior to updating the save file in your character's SaveGames\[CharacterID] folder).  Because Bags aren't unique to an area like stashes, they can be used anywhere.  This includes bringing your stashpack to another players game and accessing your stash from there. Any changes made to your stash pack, will also be made in your game's home stash.


# Important Notes
- StashPacks work in Co-op, even when you're not the host.
- A StashPack will not work in its home scenario/area if you are those host. This is by design. Use the Stash in the area instead.
- StashPacks are not useable from inside your inventory, or other containers. A StashPack must
- Pressing the equip button when a StashPack is on the gorund will automatically add it to your inventory.
- There's an option to enable crafting from any StashPacks you have "deployed" (on the ground)
- By default, stash packs are only usable in towns. There is a configuration option to enable them in all areas though. Don't forget most areas outside towns reset after 7 days though!
