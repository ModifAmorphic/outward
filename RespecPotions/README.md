# Description
Adds Blackout Potions to each town's local alchemist stock. For existing saves, potions will be added the next time the shop keeper's inventory refreshes (7 days). Drinking a potion will cause your character to forget all of their skills for a particular skill tree. Breakthrough points are refunded. This mod should also work for skills learned from other mods, as long as those mods added skill trees into the game.
