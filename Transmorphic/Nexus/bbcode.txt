[/list][size=3][b]Description[/b][/size]
Transmorphic adds a new crafting system focused on customizing your equipment's visuals. Transmog Recipes (equipment appearances) are unlocking by finding and equipping gear. Once a transmog recipe is learned, any equipment item of the same type* can have its appearance altered to look like it in the new Transmogrify crafting menu. Only equipped items are selectable in the Transmogrify crafting menu. If the item you want to transmog (or remove) is not available to select in the new crafting menu, make sure you have it equipped.*[i]1h sword --> 1h sword, 2h axe --> 2h axe, Boots --> Boots, etc.[/i]All menus can be enabled or disabled in the options / settings file. The Enchanting menu requires an enchanting table, but it is not consumed.
